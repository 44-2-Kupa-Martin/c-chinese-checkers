Use 
<binding name={decider-property}>
	<lookup [class={decider-widget-class}] name={dependant-property}>{widget-id}</lookup>
</binding>

Note:
	The decider widget has to be in the same .ui file
	<lookup> cannot find widgets by the property "name", but it can reference the top level widget if widget-id is left empty

<lookup> returns a property expression
<binding> takes a propety expression and binds it to a property of the parent object
